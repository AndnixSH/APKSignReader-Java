# APKSignReader-Java

A modified [apksig](https://github.com/AndnixSH/apksig) tool to read signature from APK file. This is purposely used for APKKiller, supports signature scheme v1 and up to v4. Unlike aimardcr's APKSignReader which can run for Android only, this tool can run on PC

### Requirements
- Java 8 or above
- Windows/Linux/macOS (Only tested on Windows)

### Usage
`java -jar apksig.jar (apk file)`

### How to build JAR file

Use IntelliJ

Build -> Build artifacts... -> Build

When you run JAR file, you may get an error `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.SecurityException: Invalid signature file digest for Manifest main attributes`. You can fix it by opening jar as zip using 7zip
and delete the following files: `META-INF/*.DSA` `META-INF/*.RSA` and `META-INF/*.SF`. Only leave `MANIFEST.MF` alone

If you know a permanent fix or the other way to compile, please let me know
